In this lab you will learn how to create a Friend's list using Express server. Your application should allow you to add a friend with the following details: First name, Last name, Email and Date of birth. You will also be providing the application the ability to retrieve details, change details and delete the details.

You will be creating an application with API endpoints to perform Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete operations on the above data using an Express server.

You will also learn to provide authenticated access to the endpoints. You will use cURL and Postman to test the implemented endpoints.
